🏥💰 Insurance Cost Prediction (Medical Insurance Charges Estimator)
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts individual medical insurance costs based on demographic, lifestyle, and geographic attributes. It uses a machine learning pipeline with Gradient Boosting to estimate how much a person might pay for their insurance plan. The project is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app where users can input their details and get an instant insurance cost estimate.
